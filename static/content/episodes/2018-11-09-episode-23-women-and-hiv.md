Women make up a [third of people living with HIV in the UK,](https://www.tht.org.uk/our-work/our-campaigns/women-and-hiv-invisible-no-longer) and a quarter of new diagnoses, yet women are often invisible in the conversation around the virus. \
\
In this episode, Adele & Hilary are joined by Sophie Strachan. Sophie is the co-chair for women's HIV charity, [Sophia Forum](https://sophiaforum.net/), who recently worked with the [Terrence Higgins Trust](https://www.tht.org.uk/) on a report looking into women living with HIV called '[Invisible No Longer](https://sophiaforum.net/index.php/hiv-and-women-invisible-no-longer/)'. Sophie talks about the findings of the report and shares her own story of being diagnosed with HIV in prison. \
\
They're also joined by HIV specialist, Dr Laura Byrne, who talks about the reality of HIV and Pregnancy, and Dr Shema Tariq talks about the [PRIME study](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/iph/research/sexualhealthandhiv/prime-study) which looks into women living with HIV and the Menopause.
