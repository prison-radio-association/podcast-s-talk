In the latest episode of Sex Talk, Hilary and Adele look into the often hidden world of Chemsex (sex under the influence of psychoactive drugs, usually between men who have sex with men). Hilary and Adele are joined in the studio by Pank who talks openly about his experience of Chemsex, which includes sex parties, prison and HIV. Hilary also chats with Monty Moncrieff from [London Friend](http://www.londonfriend.org.uk/) who talks about the support the charity offers people engaging in Chemsex.
