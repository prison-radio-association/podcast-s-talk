In Episode 6 of Sex Talk, Adele and Hilary talk all about Sex and Alcohol. We hear from the [Terrence Higgins Trust](http://www.tht.org.uk/) Outreach Team in Soho, headed up by Rebecca and Rich, as they tackle the busy bars in one of London's drinking hotspots, handing out free condoms and information about PrEP. Alex Causton-Ronaldson joins Adele and Hilary in the studio to talk about how a wild night out changed his life forever.
