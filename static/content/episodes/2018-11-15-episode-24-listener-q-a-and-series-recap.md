Join Adele & Hilary for the final episode of Sex Talk. They invite our resident sexperts, Sexual Health and HIV Specialist, Dr Stuart Flanagan, and Sex Therapist Sarah Berry into the studio to answer your questions about sex. The team talk about the changes in sex and sexual health in the UK, and reflect on some of the best moments of the series.
