Sex Talk is back for a final series! In this episode the conversation focuses on trans and non-binary sexual health. Adele and Hilary are joined in the studio by Aedan, one of the directors of [CliniQ](https://cliniq.org.uk), a sexual health and well-being centre specifically for trans and non-binary people in London. They also chat with Juno Roche, author of the book ‘[Queer Sex](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Queer-Sex-Juno-Roche/dp/1785924060)’ about her personal experiences of HIV care as a trans woman.
