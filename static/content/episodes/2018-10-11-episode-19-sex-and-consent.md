In this episode of Sex Talk, Hilary & Adele talk about sex and consent. They’re joined by George WX Barker, Director of [Sexpression:UK](http://sexpression.org.uk/), who talks about navigating consent and what consent actually means. We also hear from Anna Sale, host of the [podcast Death, Sex & Money from WNYC Studios](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/deathsexmoney) as she reflects on an episode they recently produced where consent became a big part of the conversation. [Leasuwanna](https://www.sextalk.radio/episodes/episode-8-Living-With-HIV) and [Alex](https://www.sextalk.radio/episodes/episode-6-sex-and-alcohol) who’ve appeared in previous episodes of Sex Talk also share their own stories around sex and consent. 

If you have been affected by sexual assault, [visit the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/help-after-rape-and-sexual-assault/) where you can look for your nearest sexual assault referral centre, where they offer medical, practical and emotional support.
