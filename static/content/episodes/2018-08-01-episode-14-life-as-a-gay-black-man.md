In this weeks Sex Talk we hear about the experiences of black gay & bisexual men.

HIV diagnoses among Asian & black African gay & bisexual men have been rising for the past 10 years.

Marc Thompson, co-founder of [BlackOut UK](https://blkoutuk.com/), an online community for gay black men & Phil Samba from [The Terrence Higgins Trust](https://www.tht.org.uk/) chat to Adele and Hilary about racism that they have experienced in the gay community.

They also discuss stereotypes, sexual health, homophobia and coming out in the black community in the UK.
