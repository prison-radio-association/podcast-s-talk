There has been a year-on-year increase in new HIV diagnoses among Asian & black African gay & bisexual men, and 80% of black men say they have experienced racism in the gay community. 

Adele & Hilary are joined by Marc Thompson, co-founder of [BlackOut UK](https://blkoutuk.com/), an online community for gay black men, & Phil Samba, Health Improvement Specialist for men of colour who have sex with men for [The Terrence Higgins Trust](https://www.tht.org.uk/). 

They chat about stereotypes, sexual health, coming out, homophobia, racism & mental health.
