In the final episode of Series 1, the focus is on Living with HIV. Adele and Hilary are joined by two guests, Garry, who was diagnosed with HIV 27 years ago and was told he had 5 years to live, and Leasuwanna, who was diagnosed with HIV at the same time many women in the UK are diagnosed, during pregnancy, as is the only time women are routinely screened for HIV. They both tell their inspirational stories, and talk about the incredible work they are doing helping others with [Positively UK](http://positivelyuk.org/).
