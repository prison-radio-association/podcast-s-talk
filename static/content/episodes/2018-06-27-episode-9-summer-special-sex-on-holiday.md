Adele and Hilary are back after a series break, and are joined in the studio once again by our wonderful HIV and Sexual Health Specialist, Dr Stuart Flanagan. Series 2 opens with this sexy summer special focusing on sex on holiday. We hear what the general public get up to on holiday and how safe they are when it comes to summer romances, and the team are joined on the phone by Sean Tipton from the [Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA](https://abta.com/)), who talks about what to look out for when sun, sea and sex mix!
