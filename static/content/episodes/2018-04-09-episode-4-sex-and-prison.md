Episode 4 of Sex Talk looks into the relatively unknown world of Sex and Prisons. Adele and Hilary hear from a former prisoner, Julia, who talks openly about her own experience of sex and relationships in Prison. They're also joined in the studio by Lorraine Atkinson from The Howard League for Penal Reform, who talks about the review the organisation did on sex in prisons.
