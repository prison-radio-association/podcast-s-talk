Episode 4 of Sex Talk looks into the relatively unknown world of Sex and Prisons. Adele and Hilary hear from a former prisoner, Julia, who talks openly about her own experience of sex and relationships in Prison. They're also joined in the studio by Lorraine Atkinson from [The Howard League for Penal Reform](https://howardleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sex-in-prison-web.pdf), who talks about the review the organisation did on sex in prisons.
