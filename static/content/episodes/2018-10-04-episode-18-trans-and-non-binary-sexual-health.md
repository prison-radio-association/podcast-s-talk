Discussion around HIV often focuses on ‘at risk’ groups, such as men who have sex with men and people in the black African community. In this episode of Sex Talk Adele and Hilary are joined by two people who had never even considered HIV would affect their lives before their diagnosis, Raj and Lizzie. They also chat with Yasmin who works for HIV charity [Positive East](https://www.positiveeast.org.uk/), about why every person who is sexually active should regularly test for HIV.
