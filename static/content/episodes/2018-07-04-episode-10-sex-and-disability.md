In this episode of Sex Talk the conversation focuses on Sex and Disability. Adele and Hilary talk to Brian (not his real name), a blind man in his twenties who talks about his experiences and his use of sexual services. They also chat with Rachel, an escort who lists her services through [The TLC Trust](http://tlc-trust.org.uk/), a website which provides listings of safe sexual services for disabled people, and Sex Therapist Tuppy Owens, who originally set up the TLC Trust as well as the disabled social, peer support and dating group, the [Outsiders Club](http://www.outsiders.org.uk/outsidersclub/), about why she has specialised in this area.
