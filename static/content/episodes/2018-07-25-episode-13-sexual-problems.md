Sex isnâ€™t always as easy or as carefree as some might think, with 1 in 3 people experiencing sexual problems.

Adele and Hilary are joined by sex therapist, [Sarah Berry](http://www.sarahberrytherapy.co.uk/), who chats about sexual problems which affect women, such as vaginal pain and low libido. They also talk to Hannah about her experience of [Vaginismus](https://www.thevaginismusnetwork.com/), and they hear from Peter Saddington, Sex Therapist and Relationship Counsellor for [Relate](https://www.relate.org.uk/), about sexual problems affecting men, such as erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation.
