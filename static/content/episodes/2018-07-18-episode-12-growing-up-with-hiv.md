There are currently around 1000 children living with HIV in the UK.

99.9% of babies born in the UK to HIV positive mothers do not contract the virus, as effective treatment actually prevents transmission.

This episode of Sex Talk looks at what it’s like to grow up with the virus. Adele and Hilary talk to Horcelie, who was born in The Democratic Republic of Congo and found out she had HIV when she was 11 years old. We also hear from Abi who works for the children’s HIV charity CHIVA, about what support they offer to children living with HIV in the UK.
