Episode 5 of Sex Talk focuses on Sexuality and Religion. Surveys show that around half of religious people in the UK think homosexuality is wrong, compared to a quarter of the population who are not religious. This can make it very difficult for people to come out to their communities and families. Hilary visits Reverend Jide Macauley who runs the ‘House of Rainbow’ which focuses on a person’s journey towards reconciliation of sexuality and spirituality. Adele and Hilary are also joined in the studio by Aiwan Obinyan who received support herself from Jide and the House of Rainbow when coming out to her family at the age of 30.
