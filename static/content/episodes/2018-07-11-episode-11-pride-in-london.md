On Saturday July 7th 2018, the capital was full of love and unity (and there was plenty of glitter too!), for [Pride in London](https://prideinlondon.org/). Adele and Hilary joined the celebrations in the glorious sunshine and caught up with some of the men marching with [LGBT Hero](https://www.lgbthero.org.uk/) (behind [Out Life](https://www.outlife.org.uk/) and the [GMFA](https://www.gmfa.org.uk/)). They spoke to [Peter Tatchell](https://www.petertatchellfoundation.org/), who was voted number 1 in the [Pride Power List](http://www.pridepowerlist.co.uk/pride-powerlist-2018.html) (which also included our very own Adele Roberts!) for the work he has done for LGBT+ human rights since the first UK Pride in 1972. They also caught up with Polly Shute, one of the directors of [Pride in London](https://prideinlondon.org/), who spoke about why Pride is still so important in 2018.
