On Saturday July 7th 2018, the capital was awash with colour, glitter, love and unity for Pride in London. Adele and Hilary joined the celebrations in the glorious sunshine, and caught up with some of the men marching with LGBT Hero (behind Out Life and the GMFA). They also spoke to Peter Tatchell, who was voted number 1 in the Pride Power List for the work he has done for LGBT+ human rights since the first UK Pride in 1972. They also had a chat with Polly Shute, one of the directors of Pride in London, who spoke about why Pride is still so important.
