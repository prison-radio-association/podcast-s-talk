The National guidelines for sex & relationship education in the UK haven't changed since the year 2000, but the way young people interact with each other has changed massively. In this episode, Adele & Hilary hear from three teenage girls who talk about their experience of sex education & put their questions to sexual health specialist, Dr Stuart Flanagan, & sex & relationship education expert Lizzie Jordan. The team also chat about what the new guidelines should look like when they're refreshed in 2020.
