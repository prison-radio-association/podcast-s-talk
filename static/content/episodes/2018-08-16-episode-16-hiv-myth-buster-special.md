Did you know that somebody on effective treatment for HIV [canâ€™t pass the virus on](http://www.aidsmap.com/The-Undetectable-Untransmittable-message-goes-global-II-NN-and-BB/page/3311922/)? Did you know that there is a [daily pill you can take to prevent yourself from contracting HIV](https://www.iwantprepnow.co.uk/about/)?

In this HIV myth buster special of Sex Talk, Adele and Hilary are joined in the studio by Sexual Health and HIV Specialist Dr Stuart Flanagan, and Matthew Hodson, Executive Director of [HIV charity, NAM](https://www.aidsmap.com/). Stuart and Matthew separate fact from fiction when it comes to HIV, and Matthew gets involved with our favourite game, Word Porn!
