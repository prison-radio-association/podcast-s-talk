In this first episode of Sex Talk, Adele and Hilary are joined in the studio by Dr Stuart Flanagan, a specialist in Sexual Health, HIV, and Viral Hepatitis. Hilary takes a HIV test in the studio, receiving his results at the end of the podcast. We also hear from Santiago, about his experiences of looking after his own sexual health.
